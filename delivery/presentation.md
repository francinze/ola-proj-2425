# Online Learning Applications

## Dynamic Pricing under Production Constraints

**Final Project Presentation**
*Requirements 1-4 Implementation*

---

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Design online learning algorithms for dynamic pricing of multiple products under production constraints

**Key Components**:

- Stochastic and non-stationary environments
- Budget/inventory constraints
- Multi-armed bandit algorithms
- Combinatorial optimization

**Business Context**: Company dynamically prices products with limited production capacity

---

## Problem Setting

**Parameters**:

- **T**: Number of rounds (time horizon)
- **N**: Number of product types  
- **P**: Set of possible prices (discrete)
- **B**: Production capacity (budget constraint)

**Buyer Behavior**:

- Has valuation $v_i$ for each product type
- Buys all products priced below their valuations

**Interaction per Round**:

1. Company sets prices for each product type
2. Buyer arrives with product valuations
3. Buyer purchases products priced below their valuations

## Requirement 2: Multiple Products - Stochastic Environment

### Environment: Joint Beta Distributions

**Valuation Model**: $\mathbf{v}_t = (v_{t,1}, v_{t,2}, \ldots, v_{t,N})$ where $v_{t,i} \sim \text{Beta}(a_i, b_i)$

### Algorithm: Combinatorial UCB

**UCB Estimate per Product-Price**:
$$\bar{f}_t^{UCB}(i,p) = \bar{f}_t(i,p) + \sqrt{\frac{2\log T}{N_t(i,p)}}$$

**LP Formulation**:
$$\max \sum_{i,p} p \cdot \bar{f}_t^{UCB}(i,p) \cdot x_{i,p} \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \sum_{i,p} \bar{f}_t^{UCB}(i,p) \cdot x_{i,p} \leq B$$

### Performance Comparison

**Key Results from Implementation**:

- **R2 Multi-Product UCB**: 62.9% of Oracle performance (126.90 vs 201.70 total reward)
- **Challenge**: Complex combinatorial optimization with budget constraints  
- **Learning**: UCB explored 26 unique superarms vs Oracle's optimal 3
- **Insight**: Multi-product coordination significantly more challenging than single-product
- **Budget efficiency**: Both agents achieved 100% budget utilization
- **Exploration trade-off**: Higher exploration diversity came at performance cost

## Requirement 3: Best-of-Both-Worlds - Single Product

### Environment: Non-Stationary TrendFlip
![Non-Stationary Environment](./r3_env.png)

**Valuation Model**: $v_t$ follows oscillating Beta parameters with trend changes every 50 rounds

### Algorithm: Primal-Dual Method

**Dual Variable Update**:
$$\lambda_{t+1} = \Pi_{[0,1/\rho]} \left( \lambda_t - \eta(\rho - c_t) \right)$$

**Primal Decision**: Choose arm via regret minimizer with cost $c_t = p_t \cdot \lambda_t$

**Pacing Rate**: $\rho = B/T$ (average budget consumption)

### Performance Comparison

**Best-of-Both-Worlds Outstanding Achievement**:

- **R3 Primal-Dual**: 98.4% of Oracle performance (657.50 vs 668.40 total reward)
- **R3 UCB**: 73.0% of Oracle performance (488.10 vs 668.40 total reward)
- **PD Advantage**: 35% better than UCB (1.35× performance ratio)
- **Near-optimal adaptation**: PD regret only 10.90 vs UCB's 180.30 total regret
- **Superior budget management**: PD sustained 2196 rounds vs UCB's 1885 rounds
- **Trend-flip mastery**: Excellent performance across 19 non-stationary intervals
- **Theoretical validation**: Best-of-both-worlds guarantee empirically confirmed

**Results**: Primal-Dual 98.4% vs UCB 73.0% of oracle in non-stationary settings

## Requirement 4: Best-of-Both-Worlds - Multiple Products

### Environment: Multi-Product Non-Stationary TrendFlip

**Valuation Model**: $\mathbf{v}_t$ with correlated changes across products over time

### Algorithm: Multi-Product Primal-Dual

**Per-Product Dual Updates**:
$$\lambda_{i,t+1} = \Pi_{[0,1/\rho_i]} \left( \lambda_{i,t} - \eta_i(\rho_i - c_{i,t}) \right)$$

**Decomposition Strategy**: Independent regret minimizers per product with shared budget coordination

### Performance Comparison

**Multi-Product Best-of-Both-Worlds Results**:

- **R4 Primal-Dual**: 88.5% of Oracle performance (307.05 vs 347.10 total reward)
- **R4 UCB**: 61.0% of Oracle performance (211.60 vs 347.10 total reward)
- **PD Advantage**: 45% better than UCB (1.451× performance ratio)
- **Budget management**: PD sustained operation throughout horizon, UCB depleted early  
- **Robustness**: PD demonstrated superior adaptation to correlated non-stationarity
- **Practical impact**: PD achieved 0.439 reward per budget unit vs UCB's 0.302

![Multi-Product Intervals](./r5_env.png)

**Valuation Model**: 4 intervals with different $\text{Beta}(a_{i,j}, b_{i,j})$ per product per interval

### Algorithm: Sliding Window UCB

**Windowed Estimates** (window size W=50):
$$\hat{\mu}_{i,t}^{(W)} = \frac{1}{|W_t|} \sum_{s \in W_t} r_{i,s}$$

**UCB with Sliding Window**:
$$\text{arm}_t = \arg\max_{i} \left[ \hat{\mu}_{i,t}^{(W)} + \sqrt{\frac{2\log T}{|W_t|}} \right]$$

### Performance Comparison

**Sliding Window UCB Outstanding Results**:

- **R5 SW-UCB**: 103.9% of Primal-Dual performance (821.10 vs 790.35 total reward)
